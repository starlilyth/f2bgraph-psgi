The file f2bgraph.psgi is a self contained psgi application, ready to be served
to a web server like Nginx by any PSGI capable app server, like Starman or Nginx Unit.

The required Perl Plack module usually comes in a package with 'plackup'. 
You can test your installation with something like: 

  plackup --port 8000 /var/www/cgi-bin/f2bgraph/f2bgraph.psgi

This is an example json file for configuring Unit by Nginx:

  {
    "listeners": {
      "127.0.0.1:8000": {
        "pass": "applications/f2bgraph"
      }
    },
    "applications": {
      "f2bgraph": {
        "type": "perl",
        "script": "/var/www/cgi-bin/f2bgraph/f2bgraph.psgi"
      }
    }
  }

Once the app server is running, the Nginx config entry can be as simple as: 

  location /f2bgraph/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
  }

Then f2bgraph could be accessed at https://your.host.tld/f2bgraph
